# OpenScienceBadgeCV
Examples of how to include open science badges in your CV in LaTeX

Do you want to include open science badges or other indicators on your CV?
Using LaTeX you can create a CV that people can interact with! I include open science badges and links to extra materials for projects on my CV!

The `openexample.tex` file is a LaTeX file which provides an example of creating a citation with an open science badge. 

The `OpenData.png` file is the image file to be used for the badge! 

If you're new to LaTeX, you can make a free account on Overleaf.com, upload the .tex and .png file to a project to see how it works!

It should look something like this!
